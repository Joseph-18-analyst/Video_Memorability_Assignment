# Video_Memorability_Assignment

Predicting the 'Video Memorability'- which is the extent to which a person can remember the video and its contents. It is an attempt at solving the MediaEval 2018 challenge. The organizers provide the particpants with a dataset containing off the shelf pre computed features and the ground truth of some videos are witheld. The participants are expected to come up with a machine learning solution to predict the ground truth for the witheld scores. Spearman's correlation is used as a metric for testing the accuracy of the scores predicted.
